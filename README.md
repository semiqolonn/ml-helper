# semiq-ml

A collection of reusable machine learning pipeline helpers designed to streamline ML workflows.

## Description

ML Helper is a Python package that provides helper functions and classes to simplify common machine learning tasks, including baseline model training and hyperparameter tuning. It supports popular ML frameworks like LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.

## Installation

### From PyPI
You can install the package from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install semiq-ml
```

### From Source
Install the package directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/semiq-ml.git
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semiq-ml.git
cd ml-helper
pip install -e .
```

## Features

- **Baseline Models**: Quickly train baseline models with sensible defaults
- **Preprocessing**: Simple preprocessing steps for features (e.g., imputing, encoding, scaling)
- **Feature Importance**: Easy extraction of feature importance from trained models
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from ml_helper import BaselineModel
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

model = BaselineModel()
model.fit(X, y)

model.get_results() # to get the results of the baseline model
lgbm = model.get_model('LGBM')
```
